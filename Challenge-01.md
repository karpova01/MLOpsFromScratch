# Challenge 1 â€“ Import repo into Azure DevOps

[< Previous Challenge](./Challenge-00.md) - **[Home](../README.md)** - [Next Challenge >](./Challenge-02.md)

## Introduction

The objective of challenge is to forecast the daily transactions using time series [ARIMA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoregressive_integrated_moving_average) modeling. It includes processing the transactions data from AdventureWorks database, analyzing it, creating and registering an ARIMA model, and finally deploying the model to an ACI instance. This entire lifecycle is done using [Azure ML Python SDK](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/python/api/overview/azure/ml/?view=azure-ml-py).

Time series is a series of data points collected or indexed in time order at regular time points. It is a sequence taken at successive equally spaced time points. For example, weather data collected every hour or stock data collected every day or sensor data collected every minute. As a result, we see a trend and seasonality in time-series datasets. It is this temporal nature that makes them different from other conventional datasets and warrants a different type of modeling. We will cover that in this challenge as forecasting is one of the most common and prevalent tasks in Machine Learning.

## Description

- Create and setup a new project in Azure DevOps
  - Copy yourself a of the [repository](https://github.com/karpova01/DemandForecasting) and import it into the project.
  - [Create new service connections](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/library/service-endpoints?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml) in Project Settings for your Azure ML service and Azure Subscription using Azure Resource Manager service principal. This will enable you to connect to external and remote services to execute tasks in a pipeline.
- Configure your Azure ML Workspace for the project.
  - **HINT:** Add workspace details in `config.json` in a file in the repository you copied. 
- Import the repository into an Azure DevOps project
  - **HINT:** Use the `repos` section on the DevOps portal

## Success Criteria

- Understand the contents of the python files under `service/code/`.
- Forecasting project imported into Azure DevOps.
